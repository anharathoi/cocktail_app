<h4>What type of Cocktails will I receive through Bottle Batched?</h4>
<hr/>
<p>We are constantly on the look out for old school classics, modern twists, and exciting original cocktails for us to batch, bottle and send to our Bottle Bactched members. You will get the chance to enjoy some of your favourites, discover new variations, and try something completely different as we guide you on your cocktail journey. Part of the fun is the surpise of what each delivery contains - enjoying discovering and drinking new things. We also work with many Australian producers to source local ingredents for our Bottle Batched cocktails whereever possible, bringing you a taste of the amazing products that Australia is producing. Some of the cocktails our members will enjoy are Negroni, Martini (Wet and Dry, Shaken or Stirred), Rob Roy, Old Fashioned, Sidecar,  Boulevardier, Sazerac, Manhatten, Martinez, Corpse Reviver and many many more.</p>
<h4>What comes with my subscription?</h4>
<hr/>
<p>Each delivery from Bottle Batched will contain two 500ml bottles of pre-batched cocktails, each bottle enough to make 5 to 6 serves. Also included is a receipe card for each Bottle Batched cocktail, explaining step by step how to create bar-quality cocktails in your own home. You can choose how often you receive a Bottle Batched delivery, every month, 3 months or 6 months. Your first delivery will be a little different, you will receive a 500ml bottle of our favourite Bottle Batched Negroni and all the tools you need to prepare Bottle Batched cocktails at home ... the perfect start to your cocktail journey.</p>
<h4>How do I prepare the Cocktails?</h4>
<hr/>

All that is left for you to do is impress your friends and family by preparing the perfect cocktail - just add ice, shake or stir, garnish and serve.
